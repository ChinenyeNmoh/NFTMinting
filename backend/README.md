## NFT Minting Platform API Documentation
This platform allows users to mint NFTs by connecting their wallets using MetaMask or any Ethereum-compatible wallet. The minting process is executed on the Sepolia testnet, and the smart contract manages the NFT minting and transactions. Additionally, users can manage their minted NFTs through a clean UI,and  interact with metadata stored via the backend API.
